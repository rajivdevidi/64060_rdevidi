#Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. 
#Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, 
#such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s) 
#used, the number of clusters formed, and so on.

#b. Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.

#Cluster 1 - JNJ,MRK,GSK,PFE
#Cluster 2 - AHM,AVE,WPI
#Cluster 3 - IVX,MRX,ELN,CHTT
#Cluster 4 - AGN,PHA,BAY
#Cluster 5 - ABT,NVS,AZN,LLY,BMY,WYE,SGP

#Cluster 1 has highest Market Cap, ROE, ROA,Asset Turnover
#Cluster 2 has lowest asset turn over
#Cluster 3 has highest Rev Growth and lowest PE Ratio, Asset Turnover. 
#Cluster 4 has highest Price,investments are low
#Cluster 5 highest Net Profit Margin and lowest Beta.

#c. Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters) 


#Cluster 1 with highest market cap , highest Leverage has good turn over
#Cluster 2 with highest Net Profit_Margin has max Hold Recommendation
#Cluster 3 with high rev low PE Ratio moderately recommended
#Cluster 4 with highest Price has equal Hold and Moderate Buy Recommendation
#Cluster 5 with highest net profit margin  has the Strong Buy Recommendation, high net profit.

#Clusters 1, 5 has mostlv Moderate Buv Recommendation
#Clusters 2,3,4 has Hold Recommendation

#d) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.
#Cluster 1: Growth - Because these are stable equities, this is the first cluster
#Cluster 2: Multibagger cluster - Despite their modest beta, market recommendations are extremely positive. 
#Cluster 3: Basic Cluster - Stocks with a strong financial and other fundamental foundation. Hold cluster
#cluster 4 - These are the stocks.They have a sizable following.
#custer 5: Long-term Cluster - A high net profit margin indicates that a company is doing well.
